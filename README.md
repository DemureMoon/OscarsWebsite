 The added code for branch Springboot_application is in src/main/java/com/example/simplerestapis under the two folders Controller and Models
 
 How to run from command line:
 1. Make sure Maven is installed, tutorial for that is here -->https://maven.apache.org/ and here --> https://maven.apache.org/install.html
 2. Set JAVA_HOME path; follow this very simple process --> https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/setting-the-java_home-variable-in-windows-8895.html
 3. Download/coppy the Springboot_application onto your computer
 4. Open command prompt and make sure you are in the directory that looks something like C:\Users\anima\IdeaProjects\simple-rest-apis\simple-rest-apis>
        (or wherever your folder dowloaded to)
 5. Having it run from the 2nd simple-rest-apis folder is IMPORTANT
 4. Then type mvn spring-boot:run
 5. Hopefully there are no build errors and the ASCII art for Spring appeared!
